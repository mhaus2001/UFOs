# UFOs
## Overall
The purpose of this analysis overall was to create a set of filters for the created webpage in order to better sort data based on all the avalbile headers, as such allowing for greater filtering and as well to facilitate the ability to better parse the data collected about UFOs
## Results 
In considering the results of the new webpage and the new filtering for it that has been introduced in this analyis it has allowed for the parsing of much more specific data points, this is because instead of only relying upon the date to filter and parse through the data it instead can compile information on each individual category but also those categories at the same time(as seen in the image linked below). This would mean that if someone was looking for sightings of certain types, such as lights, in a specific area and time that could be done with far more efficienacy than manuel sorting by date as the only filter alone.

 ## Summary 
 In looking at the Analysis that has been done and seeing how it could be improved, there is one correction in the filtering which would be the inclusion of the text category to better be able to parse all data categroys which is a draw back of the current system. In terms of future development however two ideas which could work well are the including of a general search fitler which could look overall categories and compile any matchs found in the data, and as well an suggest for the filter of specific data to help show what data is avalible in say the city header as using that filter currently is the least asccesible currently in comparison to the other filters.
